# !BONUS Question BONUS!
Why were `rounder()` and `measureRain()` able to use switch cases, while
functions like `happyBirthdayPet()`, `funTypes` were not? Do you prefer `measureRain()` and `rounder()` as `if/else` or `switch` statements?

# Answer
The switch statements in JavaScript can only compare primitive values. The switch expression is evaluated once. The functions like`happyBirthdayPet()`, `funTypes` still can conver to `switch` statement but it may more complicated compare to use `if/ese` statement. I prefer `if/else` because it it more easy to write and don't need to care about what have to go through the expression on the `switch` statement.

```
const happyBirthdayPet = (breed, age) => {
    switch (breed) {
        case 'snake':
            console.log('Hiss hiss!');
            break;
        case 'cat':
            switch (true) {
                case age < 5:
                    console.log('Mew mew!');
                    break;
                default:
                    console.log('Meow meow!');
            }
            break;
        case 'dog':
            switch (true) {
                case age < 5:
                    console.log('Arf arf!');
                    break;
                case age < 10:
                    console.log('Woof woof!');
                    break;
                default:
                    console.log('Boof!');
            }
            break;
        default:
            console.log('Happy birthday!');
        }
}
```

```
const funTypes = (jsType) => {
  switch (typeof jsType) {
    case 'string':
      console.log("That's just some text.");
      break;
    case 'number':
      switch (true) {
        case Number.isNaN(jsType):
          console.log("Well, now you're just showing off.");
          break;
        default:
          console.log("That's a good number.");
      }
      break;
    case 'boolean':
      console.log("To bool, or not to bool?");
      break;
    case 'undefined':
      console.log("Nothing, but I didn't set that.");
      break;
    case 'object':
      switch (true) {
        case jsType === null:
          console.log("Nothing, and I did set that.");
          break;
        case Array.isArray(jsType):
          console.log("I order you to be indexed.");
          break;
        default:
          console.log("Anybody got the key?");
      }
      break;
    }
};
```
